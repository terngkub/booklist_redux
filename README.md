# booklist_redux
Youtube webapp in react.js

### About this project
This project is a simple booklist webapp. The program will show the list of books and you can click at each book to see the book detail. I learned this from an online course ["Tutorial: Intro To React"](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux). In this project, I learn mostly about redux.
